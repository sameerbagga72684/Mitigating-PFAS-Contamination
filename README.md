### Abstract  
In California's public water systems, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination affects 65% of tested sites, impacting over 16 million residents. This paper examines California's response to PFAS contamination through policy analysis and a comparative study of PFAS levels. The research reveals a significant reduction in PFAS contamination levels, suggesting the effectiveness of these policies. While recognizing limitations, this study underscores the urgency of addressing PFAS contamination and highlights California's approach as a model for other states. Future research should explore the mechanisms through which legislation can influence contamination levels, expand testing, and assess socio-economic implications, especially in environmental justice communities. California's legislative efforts emphasize the collective resolve required to mitigate PFAS contamination's impact. This research contributes to the growing understanding of how policy interventions can address the pressing issue of PFAS contamination and calls for continued efforts to protect public health and the environment.
